This is a Spring jdbc example with some basic insert, update and delete commands...
I am adding some pictures here of these opeations...

There is a pom.xml file which contains the all dependencies.....

There are 2 java classes and 1 xml file inside src then main ....one is App.java which contains basically the input, delete and update commands...
another one is student.java which contains the objects....and there is another file config.xml which is an xml file....
